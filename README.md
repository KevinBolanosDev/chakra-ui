## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://es.react.dev/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Develop a home page with a background and a couple of buttons with your approaches to these elements, scroll states and responsive sizes for different devices, use react and chakra UI.

### Continued development

Continue practicing with Chakra UI that offers a variety of pre-designed components to generate optimal web pages.
